# MetaSUB Core Analysis Pipeline

This is the core analysis pipeline which will be run on every sample collected by the MetaSUB consortium. This pipeline uses ModuleUlta, DataSuper and SnakeMake.

This pipeline is under heavy development. Most of the documentation for this pipeline is currently internal to MetaSUB.

Collaboration by MetaSUB consortium members is welcome and encouraged.

Please contact David C. Danko (dcd3001@med.cornell.edu) if you have questions about this pipeline.
